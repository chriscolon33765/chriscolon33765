### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**My Focus**

Over 10 years of experience in tech support in small to medium companies. Driven to learn new technologies; I take pride in exceeding expectations with customers and team members; I'm in search of a company, I can contribute to and successfully grow my career in the long term.

**My Background**

I graduated ITT Tech with an AA in computer networking and a 3.7 GPA. I've worked with mostly small to medium size business helping them either establish a new network or maintain and upgrade their existing network. I started getting into web development and fell in love. I taught myself HTML and CSS and built several websites for myself, family and friends. I'm currently going to Coding Dojo to further my skills as a Full Stack developer and I'm very eager and excited about this new field.
